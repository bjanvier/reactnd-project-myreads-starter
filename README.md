# Udacity Web Specialist Project 6

## My Reads

This project is built with [ReactJS.org](). The purpose of the project was kind of builduing a eCommerce application even though it was not the case for this project.
How it works, the user has to click to the ``add book``' button icon to search for a book as the following picture shows:
![Add a book](images/add-a-book.png)

Once the user has clicked, it will be directed to search page. This how it should look like:

![Search page](images/search-page.png)

Now the use will have to click on the down-arrow to select which shelf on the main he's going to place the selected book(s)


The notification's icon on the top tells the user how many books he's added to his main main page!


Last is when the user has mispelled the name of the, the application will display as follows:

This project was one of the kind to be honest, but I'm thankful because I learned so much. [React is so awesome](https://reactjs.org)! I used Google most of the time for the things I couldn't fully understand in [Udacity's Front-End Developer classroom](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The best yet to come!!

## TO run this application, MAKE THESE FEW COMMANDS:

*   
*   First download and install [NodeJS](https://reactjs.org)
*   `git clone https://github.com/bjanvier/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git` 
*   `cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter`
*   On your command-line, run: `npm install`, which will install npm
*   `npm start`

### That's all, the last thing you will do is to have fun with the application in local server at : 
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
